# Planted solutions
Generation of planted solution (i.e. exactly solvable) Hamiltonians and loading functions.

## Loading the Hamiltonians
### CAS-solvable
CAS-solvable Hamiltonians can be loaded by the module 'LOADER.py' under the folder "CAS". Requires `Openfermion` packages on python which can be added with `pip`. This code loads the precomputed CAS fragments with the given S_I orbital grouping as parameter k, and the molecule name mol.

## Generating CAS-solvable Hamiltonians for a molecule
CAS-solvable Hamiltonians can be generated by calling "cas-run.py" under the folder "run" with command line input of the molecule name.
```
python cas-run.py molecule
```
## Detail Implementation of CAS Decomposition
CAS Decomposition is used for generating the CAS-solvable Hamiltonians. The decoposition process takes a two-body tensor Htbt and the orbital splitting k as input, and it runs nonlinear optimization with analytical jacobian to optimize the norm of the difference between the computed two-body tensor and the original two-body tensor. The details of the implementation of the process is shown in run/csa_utils.py with the main function of "csa".
