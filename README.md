# Planted solutions
Generation of planted solution (i.e. exactly solvable) Hamiltonians and loading functions.

## Loading the Hamiltonians
### Hartree-Fock-solvable
Hartree-Fock-solvable Hamiltonians can be loaded by using the module `LOADER.py`. Requires `juliacall` and `Openfermion` packages on python, both of which can be added with `pip`. This code uses the julia package `QuantumMAMBO`, which can be installed by running the file `MAMBO_INSTALL.py`.

### CAS-solvable
CAS-solvable Hamiltonians can be loaded by the module 'LOADER.py' under the folder "CAS". Requires `Openfermion` packages on python which can be added with `pip`. This code loads the precomputed CAS fragments with the given S_I orbital grouping as parameter k, and the molecule name mol.

### AGP-solvable
AGP-solvable Hamiltonians can be loaded using the function in `utils_load.py` under the folder `AGP_Hamiltonians`. Requires `Openfermion` package which can be added with `pip`. 

## Generating planted solutions
### Hartree-Fock solvable
These Hamiltonians have been generated by running the script `MF_planted.jl`. If an `Openfermion` `FermionOperator` `H` is given, it can be decomposed by running the next lines of python code (requires `QuantumMAMBO` to be installed by running `MAMBO_INSTALL.py`). 
```
from juliacall import Main as jl

jl.seval("using QuantumMAMBO")

mambo = jl.QuantumMAMBO
import openfermion as of
from openfermion import FermionOperator

Hmambo = mambo.from_OF(H)
method = "DF-boost" #method used for planted solution. See Planted solution methods for more information
OB = False #whether the one-body operator is collected into the two-electron tensor (true) or not. Setting to true makes calculations significantly slower

frag = mambo.MF_planted(H, method, OB)
Hplanted = mambo.to_OF(frag) #openfermion planted Hamiltonian

SAVENAME = "planted_molecule.h5"
QM.save_frag(frag, SAVENAME, method)
```

#### Planted solution methods
Here we give a list of different methods for Hartree-Fock-solvable planted solutions:<br>
  -DF: largest fragment from double factorization <br>
  -DF-boost: using the frame from the largest DF fragment, all number operators from the Hamiltonian are collected<br>
  -CSA: Cartan sub-algebra/greedy full rank decomposition using spacial orbitals, optimizes coefficients for both one-electron and two-electron tensors at the same time<br>
  -CAS: Complete Active Space decompositing using spin orbital basis, optimizes coefficients for both one-electron and two-electron tensors at the same time.
  -AGP-S: Symmetry shifted AGP-solvable Hamiltonian. Optimizes parameters of a two-body-tensor
