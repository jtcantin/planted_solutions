This directory contains codes used for developing and benchmarking planted solution Hamiltonians based on the killing operators and symmetries of the AGP wavefunction ("AGP-S" Hamiltonians). The folder `PlantedSolutionTensors` contains the best AGP-S approximation to the electronic Hamiltonian for various small molecules. The Hamiltonians are saved as `NxNxNxN` dimensional np.arrays, where `N` is the number of spin orbitals for the associated molecule, and the `p,q,r,s` entry of the tensor contains the coefficient for the operator `a_p^\dagger a_q a_r^\dagger a_s`. To load the Hamiltonians from this directory, one can use the function `load_planted_solution_tensor` in the `utils_load.py` file.
